## Major Update: v1.2
Another very important update for Kikitan! As you might have noticed, there are some important changes that have been made!

### Dark Theme Support
The blinding background of Kikitan can now be changed with a darker option! It is enabled by default so if you want to change the theme, you can do so by the button on top left.

### UI Updates
- Some unused fields are removed
- UI design had some inconsistencies such as different colors on different parts of the UI. Those are fixed
- Improved the animations by quite a bit.
- Added new transitions for "Recognition" and "Translation" boxes. You will notice them right away!
- Added a start/stop button. There normally was a button for that on the top bar called "VRChat OSC" but it was not obvious for a lot of people. This should be more straightforward.
- Added a donation pop up that will show up every now and then

### Feature Updates
- Added a new setting called "Disable Kikitan when muted" under the settings. This will disable recognition when you mute yourself in the game. Requires Kikitan to be started.
