**UI Updates**
• Added localization support (everything in the UI is localized)
• Fixed a bug where if a translation error were to happen, it would throw away the text that's supposed to be translated. Now it will retry for 3 times before it drops
• *Hopefully* finally fixed speech recognition randomly not picking up some of the words, especially the first word.
• UI is now resizable (with a minimum size)

**General Updates**
• Updated the donation button link (It's Buy Me a Coffee now instead of the previous GitHub Supporters)

**Please get in touch with me if you experience an issue. (Discord: sergiomarquina)**
